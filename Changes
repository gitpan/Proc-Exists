Revision history for Proc-Exists

1.00  2009-??-?? ??:?? GMT  rev. ???

0.99_02 09-04-12 04:13 GMT  rev. 615
   - use DynaLoader instead of XSLoader when the latter doesn't exist
     for better legacy compatibility (prefer XSLoader if available, 
     though, as it uses less memory)

0.99_01 09-04-11 22:50 GMT  rev. 603
   - fix Makefile.PL getcwd redefined warnings on pre 5.6 perls
   - in Makefile.PL, never try to use Errno - just use POSIX qw(), since 
     it's been in core since perl 5.
   - use Getopt::Long to simplify Makefile.PL
   - add experimental support for gcc w/ non-gcc perl on other
     (neither solaris nor hpux) OS's
   - add support for overriding CFLAGS via Makefile.PL -cflags=...
   - fix cc version display from info.t with perls built by !gcc
   - tweak the format of the TESTING file
   - add test cases: dragonflybsd, ia64/Intel CC with gcc perl
   - better, cleaner detection and handling of the gcc compiler being
     used with a non-gcc perl case.
   - silence warnings with old versions of MakeMaker related to
     LICENSE and NO_META not being understood
   - fix a bug with the perl version info emitted from info.t
   - add a configuration value want_pureperl which remembers if we want
     to use pureperl or XS. this fixes a problem with old/broken XS 
     modules in the search path.
   - support gcc with non-gcc perl on hpux

0.99  2009-04-01 05:23 GMT  rev. 537
   - better handling and detection of XSLoader problems
   - fix problem with XS on fbsd/4.11 (and other old perls?)
   - abstract away some redundant XS code into get_pid
   - cleanups, micro-optimizations, etc.
   - fix inaccurate system info from info.t (we want the running
     system, not where perl was built, yikes). also provide some more
     more information from tests, and rejigger the order in which 
     things are output, and make the output terser and clearer

0.98  2009-03-29 19:40 GMT  rev. 504
   - move perlcritic, pod, etc. tests to xt as suggeted by David Golden
     over a year ago

0.97  2009-03-29 07:49 GMT  rev. 492
   - document and improve test case for 0/undef returns with 'any' mode
   - mirror the __scalar_pexists fix from 0.95 in __list_pexists
   - perldoc updated, tidied and shuffled around a bit
   - clean up a few egregious offenses caught by Perl::Critic

0.96  2009-03-28 23:39 GMT  rev. 477
   - fix Configuration.pm magic on perls <5.6 (broken since 0.94/r466)
   - patch from Serguei Trouchelle for building with MSVC

0.95  2009-03-28 01:57 GMT  rev. 471
   - finally fix the failures coming from imacat's smoker.
     language was a red herring. the problem was using the wrong
     way to determine length.

0.94  2009-03-27 02:52 GMT  rev. 467
   - FTBFS bugfix release, oi

0.93  2009-03-26 04:53 GMT  rev. 465
   - DO NOT USE THIS VERSION, IT IS BROKEN.
   - try again with a "release" version to see if i can catch the
     probable i18n error with imacat's (or some other) smoker...
   - various kwalitee tweaks

0.92_01 08-12-17 10:47 GMT  rev. 450
   - upload for cpants, trying to figure out what's up with
     http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/12/msg2840424.html
     http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2009/03/msg3488979.html 
     pid: 1, out: 0, err: 此項操作並不被允許 (1)
     ...
     pid: 12, out: 0, err: 沒有此一程序 (3)

0.92  2008-12-15 13:06 GMT  rev. 448
   - XS: coerce input pids to int but still check them for sanity
     (die when asked about a pid '1.23' or 'abc', but '3' is ok)
     this fixes a bug where using xs and calling pexists('3'); would
     error out instead of doing the same as pexists(3);

0.91  2008-11-08 22:49 GMT  rev. 437
   - pureperl Makefile.PL goop: use Errno @ la POSIX if it's available
   - Makefile.PL now accepts an optional -cc=/path/to/c-compiler
   - Makefile.PL will try $ENV{CC} if it exists
   - add warning about HPUX and why we usually need pureperl there
   - silence warnings when Makefile.PL is invoked with perl -w

0.90  2008-06-23 08:52 GMT  rev. 409
   - API change: pexists(... {any=>1}) returns pid of process found
   - API now frozen until 1.00
   - don't muck with return value on win32 - just warn in place
   - xs and pp give same error message with non-int PIDs now.
   - implement _list_pexists in XS for extra speed, minimizing the
     perl "wrapping" around raw XS in this case
   - clean up lots of duplication in XS via static inline __pexists in
     pexists.h
   - _scalar_pexists now works on win32

0.15  2008-06-21 09:53 GMT  rev. 380
   - fix XS on perl 5.5.x

0.14  2008-06-21 08:32 GMT  rev. 378
   - catch unexpected return / errno values in _scalar_pexists
   - try cc before alternatives. add pcc and lcc to possible alternatives
   - Makefile.Pl supports --xs and --pureperl arguments, prompts
     with informative text if not given one (default XS)
   - improve error handling with invalid PIDs (strings, ints < 0)
   - fix problem with test suite where installed XS was used in place
     of the version in blib/

0.13  2008-06-04 10:19 GMT  rev. 359
   - for speed, i18n, portability, and simplicity, pp_pexists now uses
     the numeric (not string) value of $! - in particular this fixes the
     pure perl implementation with non-english locales:
       http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/06/msg1569666.html
       http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/06/msg1578246.html
   - better handling of unexpected conditions in both perl and xs 
   - add misc/gather-info.pl for better portability data gathering
   - Proc::Exists::Configuration maintains EPERM and ESRCH values
     so we needn't rely on POSIX. Makefile.PL uses POSIX only if
     it's available at build time to determine these constants,
     otherwise we use the common EPERM==1, ESRCH==3
   - POD updated.
   - bring PREREQ_PM in line with reality, even for "trivial" modules
   - solaris10/gcc hacks are no longer triggered on all gnu systems
   - fix typo in Changes file: 0.12 was released in June, not May

0.12  2008-06-01 01:35 GMT  rev. 338
   - fix an obvious, and critical bug in t/01.usage.t (raw omelette,
     yum!), thanks ANDK
   - various cleanups
   - minor optimization for the pureperl case
   - add t/01.info.t so we can glean some info about unusual OS's
     i don't have access to from smokers.

0.11  2008-05-17 23:35 GMT  rev. ~321
   - win32 code made simpler AND faster, w00t.

     but a real gcc

0.07  2008-01-22 12:39 GMT  rev. ~266

0.06  2008-01-21 18:28 GMT  rev. ~263
   - POD updates and some other minor things.
   - fast, experimental (read: non-functioning) code in Exists.xs
     for win32. this release is mostly uploaded just to see if
     anyone has ideas about how to make that code work ;-)
