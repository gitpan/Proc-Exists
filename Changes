Revision history for Proc-Exists

0.14  2008-06-21 08:32 GMT  rev. 378
   - catch unexpected return / errno values in _scalar_pexists
   - try cc before alternatives. add pcc and lcc to possible alternatives
   - Makefile.Pl supports --xs and --pureperl arguments, prompts
     with informative text if not given one (default XS)
   - improve error handling with invalid PIDs (strings, ints < 0)
   - fix problem with test suite where installed XS was used in place
     of the version in blib/

0.13  2008-06-04 10:19 GMT  rev. 359
   - for speed, i18n, portability, and simplicity, pp_pexists now uses
     the numeric (not string) value of $! - in particular this fixes the
     pure perl implementation with non-english locales:

       http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/06/msg1578246.html
   - better handling of unexpected conditions in both perl and xs 
   - add misc/gather-info.pl for better portability data gathering
   - Proc::Exists::Configuration maintains EPERM and ESRCH values
     so we needn't rely on POSIX. Makefile.PL uses POSIX only if
     it's available at build time to determine these constants,
     otherwise we use the common EPERM==1, ESRCH==3
   - POD updated.
   - bring PREREQ_PM in line with reality, even for "trivial" modules
   - solaris10/gcc hacks are no longer triggered on all gnu systems
   - fix typo in Changes file: 0.12 was released in June, not May

   - various cleanups
   - minor optimization for the pureperl case
   - add t/01.info.t so we can glean some info about unusual OS's
     i don't have access to from smokers.
