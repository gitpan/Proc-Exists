Revision history for Proc-Exists

1.01  2013-10-22 15:34 GMT  rev. 3371
   - don't use POSIX just to get EPERM and ESRCH - use %! instead
   - fix a few problems with the DynaLoader fallback, e.g. $_loader was
     being set even when DynaLoader failed, fix a do where we meant 
     eval, and stop relying on $@ checking instead of eval's return value
   - use Getopt::Long to cleanup examples/pswait

1.00  2009-04-13 02:13 GMT  rev 2421 = old-rev. 621
   - POD cleanup

0.99_02 09-04-12 04:13 GMT  rev 2415 = old-rev. 615
   - use DynaLoader instead of XSLoader when the latter doesn't exist
     for better legacy compatibility (prefer XSLoader if available, 
     though, as it uses less memory)

0.99_01 09-04-11 22:50 GMT  rev 2403 = old-rev. 603
   - fix Makefile.PL getcwd redefined warnings on pre 5.6 perls
   - in Makefile.PL, never try to use Errno - just use POSIX qw(), since 
     it's been in core since perl 5.
   - use Getopt::Long to simplify Makefile.PL
   - add experimental support for gcc w/ non-gcc perl on other
     (neither solaris nor hpux) OS's
   - add support for overriding CFLAGS via Makefile.PL -cflags=...
   - fix cc version display from info.t with perls built by !gcc
   - tweak the format of the TESTING file
   - add test cases: dragonflybsd, ia64/Intel CC with gcc perl
   - better, cleaner detection and handling of the gcc compiler being
     used with a non-gcc perl case.
   - silence warnings with old versions of MakeMaker related to
     LICENSE and NO_META not being understood
   - fix a bug with the perl version info emitted from info.t
   - add a configuration value want_pureperl which remembers if we want
     to use pureperl or XS. this fixes a problem with old/broken XS 
     modules in the search path.
   - support gcc with non-gcc perl on hpux

0.99  2009-04-01 05:23 GMT  rev 2337 = old-rev. 537
   - better handling and detection of XSLoader problems
   - fix problem with XS on fbsd/4.11 (and other old perls?)
   - abstract away some redundant XS code into get_pid
   - cleanups, micro-optimizations, etc.
   - fix inaccurate system info from info.t (we want the running
     system, not where perl was built, yikes). also provide some more
     more information from tests, and rejigger the order in which 
     things are output, and make the output terser and clearer

0.98  2009-03-29 19:40 GMT  rev 2304 = old-rev. 504
   - move perlcritic, pod, etc. tests to xt as suggeted by David Golden
     over a year ago

0.97  2009-03-29 07:49 GMT  rev 2292 = old-rev. 492
   - document and improve test case for 0/undef returns with 'any' mode
   - mirror the __scalar_pexists fix from 0.95 in __list_pexists
   - perldoc updated, tidied and shuffled around a bit
   - clean up a few egregious offenses caught by Perl::Critic

0.96  2009-03-28 23:39 GMT  rev 2277 = old-rev. 477
   - fix Configuration.pm magic on perls <5.6 (broken since 0.94/r466)
   - patch from Serguei Trouchelle for building with MSVC

0.95  2009-03-28 01:57 GMT  rev 2271 = old-rev. 471
   - finally fix the failures coming from imacat's smoker.
     language was a red herring. the problem was using the wrong
     way to determine length.

0.94  2009-03-27 02:52 GMT  rev 2267 = old-rev. 467
   - FTBFS bugfix release, oi

0.93  2009-03-26 04:53 GMT  rev 2265 = old-rev. 465
   - DO NOT USE THIS VERSION, IT IS BROKEN.
   - try again with a "release" version to see if i can catch the
     probable i18n error with imacat's (or some other) smoker...
   - various kwalitee tweaks

0.92_01 08-12-17 10:47 GMT  rev 2260 = old-rev. 450
   - upload for cpants, trying to figure out what's up with
     http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/12/msg2840424.html
     http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2009/03/msg3488979.html 
     pid: 1, out: 0, err: 此項操作並不被允許 (1)
     ...
     pid: 12, out: 0, err: 沒有此一程序 (3)

0.92  2008-12-15 13:06 GMT  rev 2258 = old-rev. 448
   - XS: coerce input pids to int but still check them for sanity
     (die when asked about a pid '1.23' or 'abc', but '3' is ok)
     this fixes a bug where using xs and calling pexists('3'); would
     error out instead of doing the same as pexists(3);

0.91  2008-11-08 22:49 GMT  rev 2249 = old-rev. 437
   - pureperl Makefile.PL goop: use Errno @ la POSIX if it's available
   - Makefile.PL now accepts an optional -cc=/path/to/c-compiler
   - Makefile.PL will try $ENV{CC} if it exists
   - add warning about HPUX and why we usually need pureperl there
   - silence warnings when Makefile.PL is invoked with perl -w

0.90  2008-06-23 08:52 GMT  rev 2237 = old-rev. 409
   - API change: pexists(... {any=>1}) returns pid of process found
   - API now frozen until 1.00
   - don't muck with return value on win32 - just warn in place
   - xs and pp give same error message with non-int PIDs now.
   - implement _list_pexists in XS for extra speed, minimizing the
     perl "wrapping" around raw XS in this case
   - clean up lots of duplication in XS via static inline __pexists in
     pexists.h
   - _scalar_pexists now works on win32

0.15  2008-06-21 09:53 GMT  rev 2208 = old-rev. 380
   - fix XS on perl 5.5.x

0.14  2008-06-21 08:32 GMT  rev 2206 = old-rev. 378
   - catch unexpected return / errno values in _scalar_pexists
   - try cc before alternatives. add pcc and lcc to possible alternatives
   - Makefile.Pl supports --xs and --pureperl arguments, prompts
     with informative text if not given one (default XS)
   - improve error handling with invalid PIDs (strings, ints < 0)
   - fix problem with test suite where installed XS was used in place
     of the version in blib/

0.13  2008-06-04 10:19 GMT  rev 2187 = old-rev. 359
   - for speed, i18n, portability, and simplicity, pp_pexists now uses
     the numeric (not string) value of $! - in particular this fixes the
     pure perl implementation with non-english locales:
       http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/06/msg1569666.html
       http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/06/msg1578246.html
   - better handling of unexpected conditions in both perl and xs 
   - add misc/gather-info.pl for better portability data gathering
   - Proc::Exists::Configuration maintains EPERM and ESRCH values
     so we needn't rely on POSIX. Makefile.PL uses POSIX only if
     it's available at build time to determine these constants,
     otherwise we use the common EPERM==1, ESRCH==3
   - POD updated.
   - bring PREREQ_PM in line with reality, even for "trivial" modules
   - solaris10/gcc hacks are no longer triggered on all gnu systems
   - fix typo in Changes file: 0.12 was released in June, not May

0.12  2008-06-01 01:35 GMT  rev 2166 = old-rev. 338
   - fix an obvious, and critical bug in t/01.usage.t (raw omelette,
     yum!), thanks ANDK
   - various cleanups
   - minor optimization for the pureperl case
   - add t/01.info.t so we can glean some info about unusual OS's
     i don't have access to from smokers.

0.11  2008-05-17 23:35 GMT  rev ~2149 = old-rev. ~321
   - win32 code made simpler AND faster, w00t.

     but a real gcc

0.07  2008-01-22 12:39 GMT  rev ~2101 = old-rev. ~266

0.06  2008-01-21 18:28 GMT  rev ~2098 = old-rev. ~263
   - POD updates and some other minor things.
   - fast, experimental (read: non-functioning) code in Exists.xs
     for win32. this release is mostly uploaded just to see if

   - Remove POD/PCritic tests from MANIFEST, distribution (still in svn)
