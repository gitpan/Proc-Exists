TODO before 1.0:
- use a new config value, useXS, instead of assuming successful load
  means we WANTED to load! this will also fix the failing test with PP
  when an old XS install exists and make testing PP easier.
- use DynaLoader instead of XSLoader for better old version compat...
  also we might be able to fix the version mismatch problem a better way
- update testing to use the new t/00.info.t based format
- check if this works with perl <5.5 (all the way back to 5.0?)
  and set META.yml as well as Makefile.PL to use 5.005 or whatever.
  see http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/CPANAuthorNotes for Makefile.PL info
- testing on all I have access to, esp fbsd4.11, osx, win, hpux, solaris
- code clean up and micro-optimization XS, PM, Makefile.PL

-- after 1.0 --

- there must be some way to do a windows/pure perl implementation...
  see if there is a pureperl win possibility via Win32.pm or
  Win32::Process. Win32::API is probably the best bet, as we can
  just sort of port the XS code over into perl-land, but it'll never
  be as good as XS. it also might be a win just to pull those in if they
  exist and have something relevant, for people who use activeperl and 
  don't have a functional cc setup, for example.

efficiency:
- write a version of pexists that is *all* XS?
- win32: use a process snapshot when we ask about a lot of PIDs,
  heuristically choose at runtime which code to run based on #pids

for better test coverage of pureperl stuff via cpants, make a test 
script that (for information purposes only) runs pureperl tests
seperately? this would break win32/{strawberry|activeperl}, so we'd have 
to check $^O and skip in that case...

svnamdin dump + svnadmin load.  dump from the old, load into the new
to get this stuff into chronicle svn
